1. a)java:- it  is a object oriented programing langauage.it is developed by the sun macro system to build the web based apllications.

   b)javac:-this is a tool of java which we used to compile the code in the command prompt.

2.a)JDK:- it stands for the "java development kit" and it is used to write and execute the code.
  b)JRE:- it stands for the "java runtime environment" it us used to run and executethe code.
  c)JVM:- it stands for the "java virtual machine" it is used to only execute the code.

3.a) .java File:-it is the extension to save the java code which is writen by the user.
  b) .class File:-It is a kanown as the amin file saved by trhe extension of the class file and it source code which is converted into the byte code.

4)Notepade++,eclips,Visual studio code these are the java IdE's


5)variable:-Variable is kanown as the storing the some informaation. and it allocate the address of the Memory Location.

		    -:it have  2 types:-
			
			1)calss level
			2)Method level
	1)calss level:-it will store the variales values in the class is known as class level.and it contain 2 types
				*static:-it is a keyword.and it will creat only one copy.
				*Non-static:-we will not using the keyword static and it creat an multiple copeis.
	2)Method level:it is the vairiable which we declared in method is called the method level variable.it have 2 types:-
			1)Local:-the variables which is declared inside the menthod is kanon as the local variable. 
			2)parameter:-the variable which is declared inside the parantesis is called the parameter.

6)By the help of the object we can creat the polymorhism,abstraction,encapsulation,inheritence, and form will be object oriented programming.


7)Compilation error


8)data-type:-keys/values it is represents the keys and values as a string.


		-:it have the two types:-
			1)primitive:-*byte(8);
				     *char('S');
				     *int (3);
				     *float(15.8); 
			             *long(744326478l); 
				     *boolean(true);
				     *double(7657.00);
				     *short(432);
			2)Non-primitive:-*array[]={1,2,3,4,5,}
					*String[] Name={"manoj", "anil", "mahanthesh", "madhu", "kiran"};
					*any class name we can use
          
9) the dot property is used access the properties and methods of a class.
		example:-this.age=new age();


10)java features:- 1)it is the plateform independet.
		   2) it is the multitasking.
		   3) it is a speed.
		   4) it is a auomoted gaurbage collection.
		   5) it is having security.
11)Array:-* it is a collection of the similar elements. 
	  *once we declared the array we cannot change its size beacause it already aquired the memory.
	  *the array is accesed by using the index.   
	example:- String[] Name={"manoj", "anil", "mahanthesh", "madhu", "kiran"};
		  boolean[] pass={true, false, true, false,false};
 
12)a)class:- the class is a blue print to craet a object and it is used to craet methods and to declare the datatypes is know as the calss.
   b)object:- it is the istance of the class is know as the object and it contains state and behavior.
.
	a)class example:-

	class Mnaoj
	{
	static void manu
		{
			syatem.out.println("i am manoj");
		}	
	}


	b)object example:-

	class Manoj
	{
	public static void main(String args[])
	Manoj manoj=new Manoj();
	}



13)keyword is a predefined variables stotred in the memory it cannot be change is known as the keyword.
		example:- const,for,while,assert,class,public,private,

14)constructor:- *it is special method.
		*it has no retun type.
		*it is used to initilize the instance variables.
	1)default constructor:-it is a no argument contructor of the parent class.
	2) parameterized constructor:-it is created by the used defined.

15)the main method is a static it only once it creat a copy of the method and use for the execute the code by only using the main method without  main methodwe can't execute.
			-:types:-static :-it creates only one copy.
				 Non-static method:- it create multiple copies.

		


16)example:-
	class Array
	{
	public static void main(String args[])
	int[] array={}
	for(int i=0; i<array.lenght; i++)
	{
	System.out.println();
	}
}


17)	a)Method:-method is a block of it will be execute when we invoke it.

	example:-class Manoj{
		void manu()
			{
				System.out.println("--------");
			}
		   }


	b)*Method overloading:- *it having same name change in the no of parameter.
			* 

		example:- class manoj{

				String name;
				int Mno;
				dopuble price;
		
				Manoj()
				{
				System.out.println("it is default contructor")	
				}
				
				Manoj(String name)
				{
				System.out.println("it is having the string name contructor ")	
				}

				Mnaoj(String name, int Mno)
				{
				System.out.Println("it i the having the string and int contructor")
				}
				}
